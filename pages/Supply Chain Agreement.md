<p>The Supply Chain Agreement entered-into-force on 24 February 2024 following
ratification by Japan, the US, Singapore, Fiji and India. The Agreement
had been signed by all 14 IPEF partners on 14 November 2023, after negotiations
were substantially concluded on 27 May 2023 – the first IPEF Agreement
to be concluded.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Supply Chain Agreement establishes the first multi-country arrangement
to strengthen the resilience and connectivity of supply chains through
collective and individual actions. Three coordination bodies will be established
to advance cooperation among IPEF countries: (a) a Supply Chain Council
that will develop sector-specific action plans to strengthen resilience
in critical sectors and key goods; (b) a Crisis Response Network to facilitate
emergency communications and coordination between governments during supply
chain disruptions; and (c) a tripartite Labour Rights Advisory Board that
will help promote labour rights in IPEF countries’ supply chains.&nbsp;</p>
