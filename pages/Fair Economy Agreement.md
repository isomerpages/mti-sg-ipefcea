<p>The Fair Economy Agreement includes commitments by IPEF partners to strengthen
their implementation of anti-corruption measures and taxation initiatives
to boost commerce, trade and investment and promote a fair and transparent
regional business environment. Partners will enhance their efforts to combat
corruption including bribery, and support efforts to improve tax transparency
and the exchange of information, domestic resource mobilisation, and tax
administration.</p>
