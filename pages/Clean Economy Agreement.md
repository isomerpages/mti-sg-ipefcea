<p>Negotiations on the Clean Economy Agreement were substantially concluded
on 14 November 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Clean Economy Agreement will advance regional cooperation to accelerate
deployment of clean energy technology, develop offshore electricity infrastructure
for unrestricted cross-border electricity trade, promote carbon market
activities, collaborate on regional and international Carbon Capture, Utilisation
and Storage (CCUS) value chains, reduce non-tariff barriers to trade of
low- and zero-emissions goods and services, and promote sustainable transport,
amongst others.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cooperative Work Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Clean Economy Agreement establishes a novel mechanism for IPEF partners
to develop and participate in “Cooperative Work Programmes” (CWPs). The
first CWP is the regional Hydrogen initiative announced in May 2023. Since
its launch, partners have organised capacity-building initiatives, including
a seminar on green hydrogen held during the Asia Clean Energy Summit in
Singapore last month. IPEF partners are exploring additional CWPs, such
as on sustainable aviation fuels, clean electricity, and carbon markets.

<p><strong>Clean Economy Investor Forum</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Clean Economy Agreement also includes commitments to mobilise investment
and finance, including through an annual investor forum bringing together
IPEF governments, investors and other private sector players, with the
objective of matching funding to projects and catalysing investment into
sustainable infrastructure and climate technology. At the invitation of
the US, Singapore will host the inaugural IPEF Clean Economy Investor Forum
on 6 June 2024. More information on the Clean Investor Forum can be found
