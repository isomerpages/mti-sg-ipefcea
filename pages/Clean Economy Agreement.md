<p>The Clean Economy Agreement was signed on 6 June 2024, after negotiations
were substantially concluded on 14 November 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Clean Economy Agreement will advance regional cooperation to accelerate
deployment of clean energy technology, develop offshore electricity infrastructure
for cross-border electricity trade, promote carbon market activities, collaborate
on regional and international Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS)
value chains, and promote sustainable transport, amongst others.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Benefits of Clean Economy Agreement</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p><u>A. Cooperative Work Programmes</u>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Clean Economy Agreement establishes a novel mechanism for IPEF partners
to develop and participate in “Cooperative Work Programmes” (CWPs), which
seeks to advance the objectives of the Agreement. To date, a total of eight
CWPs have been launched.
<br>
</p>
<p>The first CWP to be announced was the regional hydrogen initiative in
May 2023. The scope of cooperation includes exchanges of information and
sharing of best practices on methodologies, standards, and certifications
on the carbon intensity of hydrogen and its carriers as well as cross-border
pilots and demonstration projects. Since its launch, IPEF partners have
taken steps to advance the CWP, which includes organising capacity-building
initiatives, establishing workstreams related to the scope, and conducting
a supply and demand mapping exercise of the current hydrogen supply chains
landscape in the region.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The other CWPs are in the areas of:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1) <strong>Carbon markets</strong>, to identify existing regional carbon
market priorities and strategies for improving the enabling conditions
for cooperation. A two-day Strategic Dialogue was held in April 2024 which
focused on regional capacity building for carbon market implementation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2) <strong>Clean electricity</strong>, to facilitate increased decarbonisation
and access to clean energy in the region. Participating partners have conducted
a mapping exercise and analysis of existing international efforts on clean
electricity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3) <strong>Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF)</strong>, to enhance the availability
and affordability of SAF and its feedstocks, so as to catalyse and develop
regional SAF value chains in the region.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4) <strong>Workforce development</strong>, to advance employment creation
and strengthen efforts to address employment shifts in the transition towards
a clean economy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5) <strong>Emissions intensity accounting</strong>, to share information
on existing standards, reporting systems and methodologies for the assessment,
identification and trade of emerging low emissions products.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6) <strong>E-waste urban mining</strong>, to facilitate a more sustainable
e-waste management system including through information exchange and activities
to develop solutions for the efficient recovery of materials.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7) <strong>Small modular reactors (SMR)s</strong>, to support participating
partners that are seeking to advance their understanding of SMRs, and where
appropriate, introduce SMRs in their countries under the highest standards
of safety, security and safeguards.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>B. Financing Initiatives</u>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two financing initiatives have been announced as part of the Clean Economy
Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first is a US$1.2 billion <strong>Climate Fund</strong> comprising US$300
million in public financing from the US International Development Finance
Corporation (DFC), matched by another US$900 million in private funding
by I Squared Capital, a US private equity firm and global infrastructure
investment manager. The Climate Fund will be used to invest in climate
change mitigation and adaptation, including impactful and sustainable investments
across renewable energy, resource recovery, and digital infrastructure,
to reduce the carbon footprint of existing infrastructure in emerging markets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The second is the <strong>IPEF Catalytic Capital Fund</strong> to pool resources
and expand the pipeline of bankable clean economy infrastructure projects.
The fund, established by IPEF partners and administered by the Private
Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG), aims to deploy concessional financing,
technical assistance, and capacity-building support to projects such as
lender due diligence, viability gap funding, and other forms of concessional
capital in Official Development Assistance (ODA)-eligible countries. A
total of US$33 million of initial funding by Australia, Japan, the Republic
of Korea, and the United States is in progress and will be set aside to
catalyse up to US$3.3 billion in private investment.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>C. Clean Economy Investor Forum</u>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Clean Economy Agreement includes commitments to mobilise investment
and sustainable finance to accelerate the transition to clean economies
within the Indo-Pacific region. To this end, IPEF partners agreed to establish
an annual <strong>Investor Forum</strong> to catalyse investment for sustainable
infrastructure and climate technology projects in the IPEF economies by
matching private sector and institutional investors with opportunities
in clean economy-related projects in the region.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Singapore hosted the inaugural IPEF Clean Economy Investor Forum (“Investor
Forum”) on 6 June 2024 at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre. Organised
by the Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry alongside the 13 other
IPEF partners, the full day, by-invite only event successfully gathered
over 300 participants which includes the region’s top investors, cutting-edge
project proponents, innovative start-up entrepreneurs, Ministers and senior
government officials from the 14 IPEF countries, along with other organisations,
including philanthropies and multilateral development banks, to build connections,
share expertise, exchange ideas, and grow the pipeline of clean technology
and infrastructure investments in the region.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>At the Investor Forum, the IPEF partners, in partnership with PwC, identified
a total of 69 priority infrastructure projects amounting to over US$23
billion of investment opportunities. Of these, 20 investment-ready projects
worth about US$6 billion were presented to investors at the business matching
sessions. Remaining projects worth about US$17 billion were also identified
as potential investment opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, 49 climate technology startups seeking up to US$2 billion
in new funding were invited to pitch to investors. These were identified
by HolonIQ from its shortlist of “Indo-Pacific Climate Tech 100” of top
climate technology start-ups based in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
