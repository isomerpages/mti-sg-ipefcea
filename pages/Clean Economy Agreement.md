<p>The Clean Economy Agreement will advance regional cooperation to accelerate
deployment of clean energy technology, develop offshore electricity infrastructure
for cross-border electricity trade, promote carbon market activities, collaborate
on regional and international Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS)
value chains, and promote sustainable transport, amongst others.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Benefits of Clean Economy Agreement</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cooperative Work Programmes</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>The Clean Economy Agreement establishes a novel mechanism for IPEF partners
to develop and participate in “Cooperative Work Programmes” (CWPs), which
seeks to advance the objectives of the Agreement.&nbsp; The first CWP to
be announced was the regional hydrogen initiative in May 2023. The scope
of cooperation includes exchanges of information and sharing of best practices
on methodologies, standards, and certifications on the carbon intensity
of hydrogen and its carriers as well as cross-border pilots and demonstration
projects. Since its launch, IPEF partners have organised capacity-building
initiatives, a hydrogen capacity building workshop organised by Japan in
August 2023 during Japan week, and a seminar on green hydrogen held during
the Asia Clean Energy Summit in Singapore in October 2023. IPEF partners
are exploring additional CWPs, such as on sustainable aviation fuels, clean
electricity, carbon markets and just transition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Clean Economy Agreement includes commitments to mobilise investment

IPEF governments, investors, project proponents and entrepreneurs, with
the objective of matching funding to projects and catalysing investment
into sustainable infrastructure and climate technology. Singapore will
host the inaugural IPEF Clean Economy Investor Forum on 5 - 6 June 2024.
