<p>IPEF partners will seek to develop high-standard, inclusive, free, fair,
and open trade commitments that build upon the rules-based multilateral
trading system and develop new and creative approaches to trade and technology
policies in the areas of: labour; the environment; the digital economy;
agriculture; transparency and good regulatory practices; competition policy;
trade facilitation; inclusivity; and technical assistance and economic
cooperation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
